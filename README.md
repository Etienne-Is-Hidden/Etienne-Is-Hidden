HI, IÂ´m @Etienne-Is-Hidden,
been on Github since 2025-02-17

I like ... Music,
I also like ... spending time with friends,
I equally like to ... learn things!

Currently in 11th Grade (German Gymnasium)

I have experience in these programming languages:

very surface-level SQL 
surface-level C++
surface-level HTML5
basic python
basic Java

+ many many hours of scratch!

and I hope to be able to expand this list over the years!

I am trinlingual (I think?), and have a fluent level in:

German
English
French

I like to speak French the most, since it is the one I speak the least

Anyways I hope you enjoyed this README and find my code ok-ish enough!
